Summary
=======

This is a utility repository I created so that I can easily store [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/ 'Jinja template engine') syntax files so that I can use them in my vim files managed by [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle 'vundle vim plugin').

These are taken from the [Jinja script](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1856 'Jinja script @ vim.org') by [Armin Ronacher](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/).
