*husk.txt*	Mappings that boost vim command line mode.

Author: Bruno Sutic <https://www.github.com/bruno->

INTRODUCTION					*husk*

Mappings that boost vim command line mode. The goal is to have mappings
similar to bash emacs mode. You can read more about this idea in |tcsh-style|.

Plugin killer feature are <M-f> and <M-b> CLI mappings that move one "word"
right or left (notice the lowercase "word"). This is an enhancement from
vanilla vim that enables only "WORD" (uppercase) left or right with
|c_<S-Left>| and |<S-Right>|.

MAPS						*husk-maps*

All mappings are defined only in vim's command line mode.

						*husk-CTRL-A*
<C-a>		Cursor to beginning of command line, same as |c_CTRL-B|.

						*husk-CTRL-F*
<C-f>		Cursor right, same as |c_<Right>|.

						*husk-CTRL-B*
<C-b>		cursor left, same as |c_<Left>|.

						*husk-META-F*
<M-f>		Cursor one "word" right. Command line equivalent of |w| for
		normal mode.

						*husk-META-B*
<M-b>		Cursor one "word" left. Command line equivalent of |b| for
		normal mode.
