# ackmore

Stuff to make the 'ack' plugin more useful

It's git-aware and knows the root directory of your git repo.

* Maps \a to :LAck the current word starting at the git root
* Maps \A to :Ack ...
* Maps the above, in visual mode, to use the current selection instead
  of the current word.
* Maps 't' in the Quick-Fix window to open the file:line in a new tab
