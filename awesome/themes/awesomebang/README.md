#AwesomeBang by [Nicolas McCurdy](http://thenickperson.com)
A minimal, [CrunchBang Linux](http://crunchbanglinux.org/) style theme for the [awesome window manager](http://awesome.naquadah.org/).

##About
This theme is based off of the default awesome theme and inspired by the color schemes of Openbox and tint2 in recent versions of CrunchBang Linux, using similar color values and CrunchBang's default (solid gray) wallpaper. While this theme looks great on CrunchBang, you should be able to use it on any system that can run awesome.

##Installation
1. Download awesomebang and either move or link it to ~/.config/awesome/themes/awesomebang/. If you want to put it somewhere else, you will need to change the value of themedir in theme.lua to the proper location.
2. Edit your awesome/rc.lua file and change your beautiful theme so there's a line that looks like this: 'beautiful.init("/home/USERNAME/.config/awesome/themes/awesomebang/theme.lua")'.
3. Restart awesome (ctrl-super-r) and enjoy! Also, if you want to use a different font, change the value of theme.font in theme.lua to the font name and font size of your choice (it defaults to sans 8).
